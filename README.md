# FaceBaker

This project is an unofficial experimental implementation of Pixar research paper [FaceBaker: Baking Character Facial Rigs with Machine Learning](http://graphics.pixar.com/library/faceBaker/paper.pdf).

The repository contains the following modules:
* [maya_data_provider](maya_data_provider) - a module for exporting training data from Maya and importing the inferred results to Maya
* [neural_network](neural_network) - an actual neural network code for training and inference
